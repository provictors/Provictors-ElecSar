Our device- ElecSaR solves the following problems and provides a way for the community to deal with these problems: <br></br> </p> 
        <p1> 
            <li> 
                <b> HIGH ELECTRICITY BILLS- </b> In today's time as there is an extensive use of electricity in all aspects of living, this tends
                to make the electricity bills tremendously high. ElecSaR provides a systematic way to deal with the problem of high electricity bills. 

                <br></br>                  

            <li> 
                <b> COLOSSAL WASTAGE OF ELECTRICITY- </b> Our product reduces the chances of electricity wastage by making the consumer continuously aware of
                its electricty consumption which indirectly makes them to turn off appliances and reduce the overall wastage. 

                <br></br>                  

            <li> 
                <b> OVERLOADING AND SHORT CIRCUITS WITH RISK OF HEALTH- </b> Now a days due to high appliance usage by the people, the overloading 
                of circuits is often a common problem. This however can turn into dangerous and costly accidents such as short circuits 
                (leading to fires), etc. Our devide ElecSaR, brings to the table, an innovative method of solving such issues by making the 
                user consciously turn off unnecessary power-consuming devices; thus, significantly reducing the electrical load. This further 
                reduces the chances of overloading, short-circuits and fires which can cause harm to life and property.
